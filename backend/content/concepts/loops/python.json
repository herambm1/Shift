  "explanation": {
    "short": "Python has for loops (iterate over sequences) and while loops (repeat while condition is true).",
    "detailed": "Python's for loop iterates over any iterable (lists, strings, ranges). The while loop repeats as long as a condition is true. Both support break (exit loop) and continue (skip to next iteration). Python also has list comprehensions for concise loops."
  },
  
  "key_points": [
    "for loops iterate over iterables",
    "while loops repeat while condition is true",
    "Use 'break' to exit loop early",
    "Use 'continue' to skip to next iteration",
    "No traditional C-style for(i=0; i<10; i++)",
